### Terminology
#### Lexical Grammar
**The alphabet is...** -> Characters
**A "string" is...**  -> Lexeme or token
**It's implemented by the...** -> Scanner

#### Syntactic Grammar
**The alphabet is...** -> Tokens
**A "string" is...**  -> Expression
**It's implemented by the...** -> Parser

### Rules for grammars
We need to write down a grammar that contains an infinite number of strings. This can be done by creating a finite set of rules. If you start with the rules, you can use them to generate strings that are in the grammar. Strings created this way are called **derivations** as they are derived from the rules of the grammar. Rules are called **productions** because they produce strings in the grammar.

Each production in a context-free grammar has a **head** (name) and a **body**, that describes what it generates.

### Types of bodies
* **Terminal:** A letter from the grammar's alphabet, like a literal value.  In the grammar we're defining, they are individual lexemes, tokens coming from the scanner like `if` or `1234`.
	They're called terminals because they don't lead to any further moves, they are the end point. You simply produce that one symbol.

* **Nonterminal:** A named reference to another rule in the grammar.

There is one last refinement, that you can have multiple rules with the same name. When you reach a nonterminal with that name, you area allowed to pick any rules for it.
